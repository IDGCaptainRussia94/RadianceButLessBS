A very small mod that adds some extra configs to nerf some of the very difficult aspects of Stellar's Radiance mod, made in an afternoon after a strong desire to make it more playable in modpacks.
These include:

~Disable Ruin from being applied on hit
~Disable Radiance's gravity effects
~Disable Radiance's damage softcap
